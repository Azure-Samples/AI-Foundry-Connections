# ADB-Teams App 

This project demonstrates a sample Teams app that communicates with Azure Databricks Genie space via OBO (on-behalf-of-flow; logged-in user's credentials) based on the Connection configured on Azure AI Foundry portal. It utilizes sample databset deployed on Databricks Genie, but can work with any dataset.

**Disclaimer**: Sample Teams app is mean't for learning purposes only and not mean't for production. Sample shows how one can use the app on local device (laptop) using devtunnel, but one needs to deploy the app on the cloud (see homework section towards the end).  One also needs to follow standard engg best practices (security, availability, scalability) before going into production.

## Prerequisites
        - Access to Azure tenant/subscription & Teams Admin+Dev Center with appropriate roles 
        - Familiarity with Azure Databricks 
        - Devtunnel
        - Python 3.13+
        - Azure Bot Service
        - Teams App created and uploaded  on Teams Admin Center  
        - AI Foundry Hub & Project is created, Connection with Azure Databricks and LLM model (e.g. gpt-4o-mini or some other model) is deployed.

### Azure Databricks Sample Dataset and Genie

        - Use this to create dataset and deploy Genie https://www.databricks.com/resources/demos/tutorials/aibi-sales-pipeline-overview?itm_data=demo_center

                Select newly created OAuth Connection and click Test Connection. It should show successful message, but if it doesn't you need to enter the correct values.


### Create Azure AI Foundry Project and ADB Connection

        Visit int.ai.azure.com (or https://int.ai.azure.com), 
        
        Create new Project and grab **"Azure AI Foundry project endpoint"** - It needs to be used as **FOUNDRY_URL** in the .env file later
        Click Models and endpoints, and deploy Base Model (e.g. gpt-4o-mini) in the new project.  Keep **Model name** aside as it also needs to be plugged in the .env file later.
        Click Management Center hyperlink listed at the bottom of the left hand panel.
        Click Connected Resources and click New Connection. 
            Scroll down and select Azure Databricks.
            As long as your Azure Databricks instance is deployed, you will see it and one needs to select Genie in the Connection Type drop-down. 
            Next select the appropripate Genie space from the Select Genie Space drop-down.
            Make sure that the authentiation dropdown is set to Microsoft Entra ID.
            Click Add Connection.
            Note down the **name of the Connection**; it will be in this format <adbworkspacename>+'genie'+<genie room id>. 
            **ADB_CONNECTION_NAME** variable in the .env file will need this connection name. 


### Create Azure Storage Acct and Blob Container

        Create Azure Storage Acct and ensure the following

            - Anonymous blob access is enabled. Goal is to ensure that Teams app can render graphs/charts generated dynamically via the Code Interpreter tool. 

            - Go to Security + networking | Networking. Ensure that it is enabled for all public networks - Goal is to ensure that the Teams app can upload images from any IP to the container within the storage account. 

        Create Container within the storage account. 
        
        Grab the **storage acct name** and  **container name** as you will use both in the .env file.

        **Imp:** Ensure that the EntraID user(s) using the Teams app have "Blob Storage Account Contributor" role on the container.  

### Configure .env variables in your Teams app project 

        Copy .env.TEMPLATE as .env and fill the values of all variables. (Dont use <> at all)

        AGENTAPPLICATION__USERAUTHORIZATION__HANDLERS__GRAPH__SETTINGS__AZUREBOTOAUTHCONNECTIONNAME=MSFTAAD

## Accessing this sample app from Teams (browser)

    -   Make sure devtunnel is hosting the app

        devtunnel host my-tunnel

    -   In VS Code 
    
        Activate the virtual environment
            .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
            OR
            source .venv/bin/activate (Mac/Linux)

        Run the app 
        
            python app.py

    -   Access Teams via Browser https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/

        Click Apps on the left pane.
        Search for your app and click Add

    -   Now you can test the Teams app from the browser itself.  Here's the sample screenshot of ![Teams sample app](TeamsSampleApp.png)

    -   Sample questions to try out against the Sales Pipeline dataset
        -   Show the top sales reps by pipeline in a pie chart
        -   Show the no of opportunities by stage in a graph
        -   Show me the total pipeline amount by region in a bar chart
        -   What is the total pipeline amount by region?
        -   What is the average size of active opportunities?
        -   How many opportunities are in each stage?
        -   What is the average number of days to close an opportunity?
        -   Who are the top sales reps by pipeline generated?
        -   What is the total annual revenue by account?
        -   How many opportunities were won or lost in the current fiscal year?
        -   What is the distribution of opportunities by industry?
        -   What is the total pipeline amount for a specific account?
        -   What is the average probability of closing an opportunity by region?

### Some homework 

    - Enhance your learning by doing the following.
            - Azure AI Agent is being dynamically created every single time. One can resuse an existing agent to reduce the execution time.   
            - Figure out how to deploy the Python App on Azure App Service (Web App) or Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Container Service. Bot Messaging EndPoint and Domains field in Teams manifest field would need to point to the url of the deployed app. Retest the Teams app again to ensure that the app still works.
            - Learn how to build the same app in different languages (C#, TypeScript) with M365 Agents Toolkit (Refer documentation as needed)
            - Follow the security and regional deployment best practices for production readiness.
